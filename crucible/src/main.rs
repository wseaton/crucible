//! crucible, a propose→apply→measure→accept/reject→remember loop. An LLM agent proposes a
//! change to a reversibly-mutable world; a frozen judge measures it; the engine keeps or
//! discards by a generic rule and remembers the winners. A domain is a `crucible.toml`
//! manifest (see `docs/crucible-contract.md`), not engine code; `examples/counter` is the
//! litmus manifest.
//!
//! Thin driver, fat agent: each iteration hands the agent (Claude) a goal +
//! history + a toolbox, then independently runs the manifest's `measure` command and gates
//! keep/discard. The engine names nothing domain-specific; everything plugs in behind the
//! [`crucible::World`] + [`crucible::Judge`] traits, satisfied by the built-in command
//! batteries the manifest configures.
//!
//! Layout: this file is the entrypoint + the shared vocabulary (CLI, [`Args`], [`Paths`],
//! [`Prepared`]); [`run`] holds setup + command dispatch; [`loop_driver`] holds the single
//! orchestration loop. That loop talks only to a [`reporter::Reporter`], so one loop drives
//! multiple front-ends: [`console::ConsoleReporter`] for headless runs and the NDJSON
//! [`stream::SessionReporter`] for stdout/session-log runs. The choice is just `--ui`
//! (default: auto by TTY).
//!
//! Operator ergonomics:
//!
//! - Ctrl+C never just dies: it stops cleanly after the current step and prints a summary. Headless offers a steer/quit prompt.
//! - Steering: drop guidance in STEER.md (or via the prompt) and it is injected into the next iteration's prompt, the lever for when the agent goes off the rails.
